        <img src="../img/sandwich.png" alt="Picture of unassuming sandwich." width="400">
        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Not much to say here, been around forever, who knows really invented it,
                but everyone knows about it.
            </p>
            <p>Frankly, you can stick just about anything edible in between two slices
                of your choice of bread and call it done. But, since we're here, we'll
                go with the classic of condiment, protein, and fermented dairy, in between
                2 slices of white bread.
            </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>white bread - 2 slices</li>
                <li>condiment - mustard, probably</li>
                <li>protein - Let's say ham</li>
                <li>cheese - American, obviously</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Lay out your 2 slices of bread.</li>
                <li>Apply your desired amount of condiment.</li>
                <li>On one slice, slap that ham down.</li>
                <li>Toss on the cheese.</li>
                <li>Flip that empty bread slice on top.</li>
                <li>Enjoy.</li>
            </ol>
